# THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN - Rock, paper, scissors

A simple app where two players can face off in a rock, paper, scissors match.
The rules are simple, one game decides the winner.

## Example of how a game could look like

1. Player 1 sends a request to create a new game and gets back a game ID from the server.
2. Player 1 sends the game ID to player 2 via any communication channel. (eg mail, slack or fax)
3. Player 2 joins the game using the game ID.
4. Player 1 makes his move (Stone).
5. Player 2 makes his move (Scissors).
6. Player 1 checks the state of the game and discovers that he has won.
7. Player 2 checks the state of the game and discovers that he lost.

## How to set up the game

To load all the dependencies open up your command line and navigate to the root of the
project and execute using one of the following commands:

```bash
bun install
```

Start the server using one of the following commands:

```bash
bun run start
```

Make calls to the server using your favorite way of API testing. Such as:
